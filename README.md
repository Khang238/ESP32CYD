## NoID Pro 4.7.02
**Creator:** Khang238  
**Date:** 04 - 04 - 2025

### Changes
- Added ability to upload files from phone/PC to ESP32 via WebServer *(I wanted to do this for a long time, but I was too lazy)*
- Changed the default value of **"Picture Color Boost"** to `2.4` *(because why not)*
- Added **"Touch Test"** and **"Web Browser"** *(Web Browser is not working yet, so don't touch it)*
- Changed the way you interact with **"Files"**:
  - Removed **"Reload Path"** and **"Add Path"** *(they suck)*
  - Replaced them with **"Return"** and **"Open"** *(because why not)*
  - Added new **"Remove"** button *(this will be changed to **"Option"** in the next update so you can do more than just remove)*
  - **"Remove"** button still has a bug *(like removing **"nothing"** when opening an empty folder)*, so **don't touch it** *(or just avoid using it the wrong way)*

### Thank You To:
- **Khang238** *(me, because why not)*
- **ChatGPT** *(seriously)*
- **Copilot** *(thanks so much for suggesting some stupid compilations)*
- **Espressif** *(for ESP32, they are not sponsoring me, but I highly recommend them)*
- **Arduino** *(because they use C++, efficient and not painful like Python)*  
*(If you're another coder and have made changes to this, feel free to add your name here.)*

### NoID Program
**Device:**
